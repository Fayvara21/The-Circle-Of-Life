# The-Circle-Of-Life

Wherever we look at, whatever we imagine, everything revolves around a geometrical shape.
they built our world by making the wilderness a place of comfort and security,
they allowed us to achieve the unthinkabe; we went to space, we cloned humans, we even made information travel faster than the speed of sound.
every shape made a difference in that quest to the impossible, 
but what if i told you the world mankind built is lacking in something that used to be fundamental in our universe, 
something that dictates our very futur, something that was the basis of every invention imaginable.

The Circle.
Between the planet we live in and a simple bubble of soap, it's the most energy efficient shape that space can create.
we feel safe when its borders are around us, we feel joy when we see it spin.
when we see a circle, we think about something nice and positive, it reminds us of the simplicity of this world.
can you say the same about isosceles triangles? it's both weak and threatening. screw you triangle, you're useless.

By making this gorgeous piece of art, I realised that the most simple way to draw a face is also the most simple way the universe was created.
Every drawing is the creation of a new universe. But what if i wasn't the only one who could build on it's fundations?
If you were to acquire The Circle, you would be the very first human to achieve this unimaginable feat.

Thank you.
